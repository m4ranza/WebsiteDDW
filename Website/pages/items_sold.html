                <p>The Air Max 97 "Satan" by Lil Nas X and MSCHF contains human blood
                    BROWSE THE GALLERY
                    The journey to Hell undertaken by Lil Nas X within the music video of MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name) would seem to have marked the young singer who, with the help of MSCHF, has created a version of the Air Max 97 entirely inspired by the figure of Satan.
                    The sneaker outgoing seems to be the sequel to the much acclaimed Air Max 97 blessed with holy water and soaked in incense, released in only 14 pairs almost two years ago. This, however, is not the case of blessings because the sneaker boasts an aggressive look, proposed in the coloring "Triple Black", on which reign supreme a series of red details. First of all is the writing "Luke 10:18", reference to the Bible verse in which we read this scene: "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven"; on the heel is then engraved the number of the pair, there are in fact only 666 - not a causal number - copies made. Another key feature is the satanic star made as if it were a jewel and applied to the lacing system.</p>

                <h2>Fila Women’s Disruptor Premium 2 Sneaker</h2>
                <p>Brock describes her style as sporty and girly and says sneakers are her go-to shoe style. She looks for options that support a wider foot, look good, and can be dressed up or down depending on the assignment. These chunky Filas, which she has in a stylish pink floral pattern only available on resale sites, are great for working long hours. “They truly feel like you are walking on a cloud.” Plus they slip on and off easily, which she says made them great for travel pre-pandemic. “I’ve traveled from New York to England and Egypt with them.”</p>
